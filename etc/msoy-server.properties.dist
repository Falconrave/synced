# A pattern used to generate the server_host value for nodes based on their
# node id using printf-style formatting. In production we would use:
#
# server_host_pattern = whirled%d.whirled.com
#
# A developer installation should leave this value commented out.

# server_host_pattern = whirled%d.whirled.com

#
# If uncommented, this value will be used to adjust the server_ports, http_port
# and game_server_port settings for each node by adding this offset and the
# node's id to the default values for those configurations like so:
#
# node_value = default_value + node_port_offset + node_id
#
# So if you set http_port to 8080 and node_port_offset to -1 then:
#
# msoy1.http_port = 8080 (default) + -1 (offset) + 1 (node id) = 8080
# msoy1.http_port = 8080 (default) + -1 (offset) + 2 (node id) = 8081
# etc.

# The same goes for the server_ports values and the game_server_port value.
# This is only useful for local developer's deployments where they run multiple
# servers on the same machine.
