The flex_sdk is obtained via an svn external from the ooo-libs project. If you
want to update the flex_sdk, you should update the flex_sdk in ooo-libs/lib and
then invoke:

svn propedit svn:externals .

in this directory and change:

flex_sdk svn+ssh://src.earth.threerings.net/ooo-libs/trunk/lib/flex_sdk_3_b3

to reference the path to the new flex_sdk in ooo-libs.

The build server will probably freak out as well because svn isn't very good
about replacing one external with another. Some day perhaps we can come up with
a better solution.
