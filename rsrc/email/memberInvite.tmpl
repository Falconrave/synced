Join ${friend} in creating the First Whirled
You've been invited by a friend to join the Alpha Test of Whirled, Three Rings'
new web-based social world for chat, games and player-created content:

"${custom_message}"

You can create an account by activating your invitation here:

${server_url}/#invite-${invite_id}

Because Whirled is in an early stage, we are asking that participants not share
information about the project with anyone, or post about it publicly for the
time being. Please also do not give out your logon information (not a good idea
in any circumstance).

Note also: Whirled currently only works well in Firefox. We're working on
Internet Explorer and Safari support but there are currently problems with
those browsers. If you don't have Firefox, you can download it here:

http://getfirefox.com/

You will also need the latest Flash plugin installed. You probably already have
it installed, but if you run into any troubles, grab the latest version from
here:

Have fun and thanks for helping build our new Whirled,

The Keepers of the Peas
