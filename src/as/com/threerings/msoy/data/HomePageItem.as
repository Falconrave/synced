 * A home page item is shown to the user within a flash popup in their home room. It is currently a
 * quick implementation to give Deviant Arts users links to all the things that they may want to do.
 * Each item specifies a specific activity in whirled. As far as possible, no further information
 * should be required to engage in the activity. For example, the game item goes straight to a game
 * lobby rather than a screenload of links to other games.
