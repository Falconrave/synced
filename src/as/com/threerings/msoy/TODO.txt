- Write a processor to process java files, and create corresponding AS files.

  Mike already wrote a processor for java class files, but APT would be more
  standard since it's a part of the JDK. It also allows the one additional
  feature of being able to examine compile-time annotations, which might
  be useful for us: we could create specific annotations to disambiguate
  things when converting to AS.

  - process Streamable objects to make them into AS classes that have manual
    streaming
  - process DObject classes to generate AS equivalent.. same as Streamable?
  - service client/data classes in AS? Maybe rewrite mike's stuff using APT.

  We're going to wait on this until we see what's coming in beta3.


- Adding a youtube video to our client screws up the scale. Fix? We should
  probably generate some "worst case" swfs that try to fuck the stage or
  the VM as much as possible, and safeguard against things.

- The error images are suddenly having their black bits go transparent
  during the rotate/move effects. Strange!

- Determine security settings for loading sub-swfs.

  - Should they be able to access the network?
    - I think "no", because they can soak bandwidth, security concerns.
  - min/max sizes
    - ???
  - can they be invisible?
    - hard to enforce if animating
  - sound?
    - enforceable?

- Determine the method of communication with "avatar swfs",
  - Direct calls to an API
    - Issue: Security
  - LocalConnection
    - Issue: No correllation between DisplayObject and the connection.
      Solution: append object id to URL so that the swf may examine it
                and know which named connection to use.
                However, this breaks browser caching.
    - Issue: swfs may listen to invalid connection names or send messages
             to other swf LocalConnections.
      Solution: (partial) We place the media server is in a different domain
               (I think that for security purposes a domain is the full
                server name, so this may already be true) and client swfs
                only allow the domain that serves the msoy client swf.
  - Events passed down from the Loader.
    - This kicks ass, and the events are passed through Security and
      ApplicationDomains. It almost seems a loophole and I wonder if custom
      event classes work...
    - Issue: I'm not sure if there's an equivalent for older swfs.
      Still researching.
  - Using ExternalInterface to set up a fakey LocalConnection-type thing
  - Using SharedObject to communicate
    - Issue: can be disabled by the user
  - [There may be other ways to inter-communicate]

  - I just talked a bit with Mike. What we're going to aim for is a hybrid
    solution for now (assuming the event thing doesn't work with AVM1)
    and use the event thing for newer swfs and the non-optimal LocalConnection
    for older ones. The upgrade path is towards The Goodness.

- Make the IntegerStreamer also handle straight int objects. We might
be able to just hide the funny business inside the streamer.

  *** Can't: there's no way to determine if a number is a Number or an int.
  A Number that refers to an integer value will look like an int. Fucked!

  *** Look into this more, god it would just make lots of things better..

- Create a chameleon avatar that manipulates the pixels behind it?

- Examine the parents above a RoomView, see if things can be slimmed
