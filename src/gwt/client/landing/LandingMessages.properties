  is a complete, self-serve Flash game development platform. Using Whirled it is \
  possible to create and charge for virtual items, single and multiplayer games, \
  avatars, furnishings, and much more by selling directly to players. It was created \
  by online gaming pioneers Three Rings Design and represents years of \
  micro-transaction learning packaged into a Flash development and billing \
  framework.</p> \
  <p>The Whirled Flash Game Developer Challenge is a standing game development contest \
  that runs every three months. All games that are uploaded to Whirled during the \
  contest period and comply with the below conditions are eligible.  There are two \
  categories for prizes - single and multiplayer games.  The multiplayer game category \
  also includes <a href="http://wiki.whirled.com/Avrg">MMO/AVRG-style games</a> that \
  are played within the Whirled itself.</p>
