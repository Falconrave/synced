# Developer Introduction Landing page

devintroWhatTitle = What is Whirled?
devintroWhatText = \
  <p><a href="/">Whirled</a> is a complete, self-serve Flash game development \
  platform that enables you to build deep experiences, audience, and revenue. Using Whirled it \
  is possible to create, manage, and monetize virtual items, single and multiplayer games, \
  avatars, furnishings, and much more by selling directly to players. It was created by online \
  indie gaming pioneers Three Rings Design, the developers of Puzzle Pirates, and represents \
  years of micro-transaction learning packaged into a Flash development and billing \
  framework.</p>\
  \
  <p>Whirled is designed to scale with your ambitions and how you want to grow your business. \
  Whether you want to create a casual single player puzzle experience, a deep multiplayer \
  action game based on micro-transactions, a full blown Flash MMO, or anything in between...\
  we''ve got you covered. Create what you want at your own pace, price and deploy it however \
  makes sense to you and your community.</p>\
  \
  <p>Three Rings is known as a strong advocate for open source and in addition to the full \
  platform API set, complete code for all of our Whirled games is available for download from \
  the <a href="http://wiki.whirled.com/Main_Page">Whirled wiki</a>. Whatever you want to build \
  on Whirled, this expanding code library will help you get there.</p>

devintroRevenueTitle = Building Revenue on Whirled
devintroRevenueText = \
  <img style="float: right;" alt="Funnel" src="/images/landing/devintro_revenue_funnel.jpg"/>\
  <p>The Whirled billing engine supports over 50 different payment methods from around the \
  world including credit cards, PayPal, mobile/premium SMS, and a large variety of prepaid \
  cards. Three Rings player support is fully integrated as well so you can focus on building \
  your brand and revenue without the headaches and overhead of billing, fraud, or customer \
  service. All net revenue on Whirled is split four ways as per the graphic to the right. \
  There are currently four ways to earn money on Whirled. You can make use of some or all of \
  these methods at your discretion.</p>\
  \
  <h3>1. Games & Virtual Item Sales</h3>\
  <p>By integrating specific Whirled APIs into your game, you can sell games, levels, and/or \
  items. Additionally, you can sell a variety of virtual items such as avatars, toys, pets, \
  and furniture outside of your game. You set the pricing for all of your work and have a \
  variety of options for merchandising it.</p>\
  <img style="margin: auto;" alt="Items" src="/images/landing/devintro_example_items.png"/>\
  \
  <h3>2. Affiliate Program</h3>\
  <p>All content in Whirled can be embedded out to other sites, including your own. All \
  embedded content is eligible for the Whirled affiliate program wherein the the affiliate \
  earns 30% of lifetime net revenue on referred players. In other words, for every player \
  you refer you earn 30% of whatever they spend within Whirled over the course of their \
  lifetime on Whirled. In cases where you are both the affiliate and the developer of a given \
  virtual item sale, your combined percentage would therefore be 60%.</p>\
  \
  <h3>3. Game Developer Bonus Pool</h3>\
  <p>Every month, Three Rings will set aside a pool of money to be split among game developers \
  in direct proportion to the number of gameplays their game represents of the overall total \
  on Whirled. For January 2009, the Game Developer Bonus Pool is currently set at $10,000.</p>\
  \
  <h3>4. Contests</h3>\
  <p>Whirled frequently runs contests for Flash creators.  <a href="#me-contests">Click \

  <a href="#games-d_393_t">QBeez</a> is an example of an \
  existing single player game that was not built for Whirled but has been modified to take \
  advantage of micro-transactions by selling level packs and \
