  the player, can contribute and sell new avatars, room decor, music, pets and games.</li> \

  You can build out additional rooms.  Most web content can be embedded in your room, \
  including video and music.</li> \
  <li>Find and invite friends to Whirled to play games, chat, or throw parties.</li> \
  <li><i>Whirleds</i> allow collaboration with other players around shared interests, \

  </ul> \
  <h3>How do I get more coins?</h3> <ul> \
