# Image Editing blurb (top below divider)

editorBlurb1 = Images must be GIF, PNG or JPG format.  You can add then to \
  <a href="#world-home">your room</a> like furniture, or create a \
  <a href="#people-create">Gallery</a> to display them.  Animated GIFs don''t work inside rooms.
editorBlurb2 = 
editorBlurb3 = Furniture can either an image or a SWF file. If your furniture is interactive \
  instead of just animated, you should consider uploading it as a toy.
editorBlurb4 = Whirled games are developed in ActionScript 3 (AS3) either using the \
  standalone compiler or the Flash 9 Authoring Tool. Integrate your game with Whirled by \
  following the <a href="http://wiki.whirled.com/Create_games">wiki</a>.
editorBlurb5 = Avatars can only be SWF files. If you want to upload a static image as your \
  avatar, we suggest you look at the <a href="#shop-l_5_1609">easy image avatar</a>. It''s free \
  and you can remix it with your static image.
editorBlurb6 = Pets are animated characters that wander rooms, change moods, and \
  interact with players. Pets can only be SWF files. If you want to upload a static image as \
  your pet, buy a free <a href="#shop-l_6_404">easy image pet</a> instead.
editorBlurb7 = Music and sound effects can be added to <a href="#world-home">your room</a>, \
  and must be MP3 format.
editorBlurb8 = Videos must be in FLV format.
editorBlurb9 = Backdrops can be images (GIF, PNG, or JPG format images) or Flash SWF files.  \
  For animation, use SWF format as GIFs won''t be animated inside of rooms.
editorBlurb10 = Toys in Whirled are interactive, so they can only be SWF files.  If you want \
  to create a picture of a toy that doesn''t move, create <a href="#stuff-c_3">Furniture</a> \
  instead.
