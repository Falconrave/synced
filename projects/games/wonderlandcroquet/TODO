* Terrain - hit testing doesn't work if the sprite isn't on screen, so the 
  current method doesn't work unless we force you to be zoomed out enough to 
  see everything whenever something is rolling. Bleh.
* Fix auto-panning for non-default zoom
* Pan to coordinate, don't snap
* Pan and track ball movement
* Take clicks on markers in the status view and pan to that ball
* Fix drag behavior when mouse leaves window; look at chat's scrollbar to see
  how it does it - appears it has to do with hooking into the systemManager to
  listen for events as well. See also: mx.controls.Button
