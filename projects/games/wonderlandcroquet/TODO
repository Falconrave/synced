* Flamingo mallets for shooting
* Terrain - hit testing doesn't work if the sprite isn't on screen, so the 
  current method doesn't work unless we force you to be zoomed out enough to 
  see everything whenever something is rolling. Bleh.
* Pan to coordinate, don't snap
* Pan and track ball movement
* HUD
* Better indication of who owns which ball (name over it when stationary?)
* Fix drag behavior when mouse leaves window; look at chat's scrollbar to see
  how it does it
* End game indication (right now we NPE looking for the next wicket)
