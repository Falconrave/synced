         <p><b>Virtue Dev. uses your personal information to operate and improve Synced, and will not give your personal information to third parties except to operate, improve and protect the Service. </b></p>
          <p>The personal information you provide to us during registration is used for Virtue Dev.' internal purposes only. Virtue Dev. uses the information it collects to learn what you like and to improve the Service. Virtue Dev. will not give any of your personal information to any third party without your express approval except: as reasonably necessary to fulfill your service request, to third- party fulfillment houses, customer support, billing and credit verification services, and the like; to comply with tax and other applicable law; as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement or as otherwise authorized by you; to law enforcement or other appropriate third parties in connection with criminal investigations and other investigations of fraud; or as otherwise necessary to protect Virtue Dev., its agents and other users of the Service. Virtue Dev. does not guarantee the security of any of your private transmissions against unauthorized or unlawful interception or access by third parties. Virtue Dev. can (and you authorize Virtue Dev. to) disclose any information about you to private entities, law enforcement agencies or government officials, as Virtue Dev., in its sole discretion, believes necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, or as otherwise required by law. If you request any technical support, you consent to Virtue Dev.' remote accessing and review of the computer onto which you load Virtue Dev. Software for purposes of support and debugging. You agree that Virtue Dev. may communicate with you via email and any similar technology for any purpose relating to the Service, the Virtue Dev. Software and any services or software which may in the future be provided by Virtue Dev. or on Virtue Dev.' behalf. You agree to read the disclosures and be bound by the terms of the additional Privacy Policy information posted on our website at Privacy Policy.</p>
          
<p><b> Virtue Dev. may observe and record your interaction within the Service, and may share aggregated and other general information (not including your personal information) with third parties.</b></p>

<p>You acknowledge and agree that Virtue Dev., in its sole discretion, may track, record, observe or follow any and all of your interactions within the Service. Virtue Dev. may share general, demographic, or aggregated information with third parties about our user base and Service usage, but that information will not include or be linked to any personal information without your consent.</p>

<p><b> Content Inside Synced may observe and record your interaction with the Service which may be passed to third parties</b></p>

<p>Synced content such as Pets, Toys, Avatars and Games contributed by players may contain software code that, using the Synced APIs, may observe your actions on the service. For example, Pets can react to chat in a room, a Toy could observe your IP address, or a Game could keep a record of when you play. These player-created items may store this information on Synced's servers, or transmit and store it elsewhere on third-party servers. Synced has no control over the use of this information by third parties, and for this reason you should not engage with Synced with the expectation that your interactions with the service are private from third parties. For more detail on what information can be discerned in this way, please consult the Synced API documentation.</p>

<p><b>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</b></p>

<p>If a dispute arises between you and Virtue Dev., our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Accordingly, you and Virtue Dev. agree to resolve any claim or controversy at law or in equity that arises from or relates to this Agreement or our Service (a "Claim") in accordance with one of the subsections below.</p>

<p><b>Governing Law</b></p>

<p>This Agreement and the relationship between you and Virtue Dev. shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the TBA without regard to conflict of law principles or the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.</p>

<p><b>Forum for Disputes</b></p>

<p>You and Virtue Dev. agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the TBA, except as provided in Subsection 7.3 below regarding optional arbitration. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Virtue Dev. shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p><b>Optional Arbitration</b></p>

<p><b>For any Claim, excluding Claims for injunctive or other equitable relief, where the total amount of the award sought is less than ten thousand U.S. Dollars ($10,000.00 USD), the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the Claim in a cost-effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. A party electing arbitration shall initiate it through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions; (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</b></p>

<p><b>Improperly Filed Claims</p></b>

<p>All Claims you bring against Virtue Dev. must be resolved in accordance with this Dispute Resolution Section. All Claims filed or brought contrary to this Dispute Resolution Section shall be considered improperly filed. Should you file a Claim contrary to this Dispute Resolution Section, Virtue Dev. may recover attorneys' fees and costs up to one thousand U.S. Dollars ($1,000.00 USD), provided that Virtue Dev. has notified you in writing of the improperly filed Claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the Claim.</p>

<p><b>GENERAL PROVISIONS</b></p>

<p>The Service is controlled and operated by Virtue Dev. from its office in the United States. Virtue Dev. makes no representation that any aspect of the Service is appropriate or available for use in jurisdictions outside of the United States. Those who choose to access the Service from other locations are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. The Virtue Dev. Software is subject to all applicable export restrictions. You must comply with all export and import laws and restrictions and regulations of any United States or foreign agency or authority relating to the Virtue Dev. Software and its use.</p>

<p>Virtue Dev.' failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive Virtue Dev.' right to act with respect to that breach or subsequent or similar breaches. No consent or waiver by Virtue Dev. under this Agreement shall be deemed effective unless delivered in a writing signed by a duly appointed officer of Virtue Dev.. All or any of Virtue Dev.' rights and obligations under this Agreement may be assigned to a subsequent owner or operator of the Service in a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of Virtue Dev.' assets. You may not assign or transfer this Agreement or any or all of your rights hereunder without the prior written consent of Virtue Dev., and any attempt to do so is void. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, no default, delay or failure to perform on the part of Virtue Dev. shall be considered a breach of this Agreement if such default, delay or failure to perform is shown to be due to causes beyond the reasonable control of Virtue Dev.</p>

<p>This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between you and Virtue Dev. with respect to the subject matter hereof. The section headings used herein, including descriptive summary sentences at the start of each section, are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then in such jurisdiction that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>Virtue Dev. may give notice to you by means of a general notice on our website at http://syncedonline.com, through the Synced Client at or after log-in to your Account, by electronic mail to your e-mail address in our records for your Account, or by written communication sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, or overnight courier to your address on record for your Account. All notices given by you or required under this Agreement shall be faxed to Virtue Dev. Legal Department, Attn: Dispute Resolution, at: TBA; or mailed to us at: TBA.</p>          
          
        <p><b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b></p>
        <p>Virtue Development may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in
          the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the email address
          specified in your Virtue Development account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.</p>
