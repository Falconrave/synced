<td><b>Welcome to the First Synced!</b>

<p> Synced is a social online world for chat and multi-player games, powered
by player-created content. <a href="http://www.virtuedev.site88.net">Virtue Development'</a>
With Synced we are trying to do something different -- in Synced the players create the characters,
rooms and (in due course) the games. We hope that this will be a lot of fun for
everyone! </p>

<p> To get started, you should <a href="/index.html">head into the Synced</a>. You
will need to login with your email address and the password you were
sent. Please then click "Me" -> "Account" and configure your Permaname which
will allow you to log into the <a href="http://synced.wikia.com/wiki/Forum:Index">Forums</a>
and the <a href="http://synced.wikia.com/wiki/Synced_Wikia">Wiki</a>. You can access the Forums
and Wiki from the menu navigation in the Synced once you've logged in. </p>

<p> We will be active on the forums and in the world so feel free to post
questions and comments there or say hello if you see us in Synced. </p>

<p> Thanks again for coming and playing around with our very incomplete new
project. We look forward to seeing and playing with the cool stuff you
make. </p>
