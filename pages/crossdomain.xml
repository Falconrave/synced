  TODO
  Notice:
  This file is needed so that we may examine our image media as data
  inside metasoy. We need to examine the images as data so we may
  perspectivize them and also correctly hitTest transparent pixels.
  Prior to launch, we'll want to ensure that we allow the domain
  from which the metasoy clients are served and probably deny all others.
